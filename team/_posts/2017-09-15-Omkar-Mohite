I am curious about unraveling complexities in biological systems using computational and mathematical tools. My work is aimed at understanding redundancies in genome scale metabolic networks through analysis of synthetic lethals. I have received B.Tech. and M.Tech. in Biological Engineering from IIT Madras. I am currently working as a Junior Research Fellow in the lab of Dr. Karthik Raman.
I love travelling, trekking and listening to rock music. I am an amateur weightlifter and follow the sport passionately.
